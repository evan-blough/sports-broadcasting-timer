Welcome to the Sports Broadcasting Timer!

This is intended for use with OBS for streaming sporting events, such as basketball, football, and soccer. 

To download the executable, download the zip file and extract. 

Simply add the text files as text components to OBS and run!

Made this with intent to create a better, easier to use application for scorekeeping on livestreams after facing some difficulties with other open-source project in previous years.
It's simple, but it's meant to be easy to get up and running quickly to make streaming as easy as possible!
